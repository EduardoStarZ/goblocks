# Goblocks
Goblocks is a [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) status bar program partially inspired by [dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks).

It is lightweight, fast, multithreaded, well(-ish) documented and easily customizable. It is also one of very few status bars done correctly. Most of them "naively"
scan for changes every 1s or so, whereas goblocks only updates when there are updates to be done.
## Installation
Pull this repo and run:
```
make install
```
This will build this project and generate default config file at $HOME/.config/goblocks.json. After that you can simply run it with
```
goblocks &!
```

If you want to uninstall it, just run.
```
make uninstall
```

## Customization
You can add your own blocks in [config file](https://github.com/Stargarth/Goblocks/blob/master/goblocks.json). Just remember to modify config at ~/.config/
goblocks.json.
After you have applied your changes, just re run the aplication.

In order to add new block to the bar add new action object to actions array in goblocks.json:
```
"actions": 
	[
		{
			"prefix": "ðŸ—“ ",
			"updateSignal": "35",
			"command": "#Date",		
			"format": "Monday 02/01/2006 15:04:05",		
			"timer": "1s"
		},
		{
			"prefix": "ðŸ”Š ",
			"updateSignal": "36",
			"command": "amixer get Master | awk ' \/%\/ {print $5 $6}' | head -1 | sed -e 's\/]\\[\/ \/g'",
			"timer": "0"
		},
		{
			"prefix": "Mem: ",
			"updateSignal": "37",
			"command": "#Memory",
			"suffix": "%",
			"timer": "2s"
		},
		{
			"prefix": "CPU: ",
			"updateSignal": "38",
			"command": "#Cpu",
			"suffix": "%",
			"timer": "2s"
		}
	]
```
### Config properties
1. **prefix(optional)**:text that will be displayed before the output of command.
2. **updateSignal**: signal that can be sent to goblocks to re-run the command and refresh output in bar. This value must be in range 34-64 inclusive.
3. **command**: functionality that will produce the text for status bar. If it starts with hash-tag goblocks will try to invoke corresponding built-in function. 
If it doesn't then goblocks will run command in shell(sh) and put it's output in status bar. 
4. **suffix(optional)**: Text that will be displayed after the output of command
5. **Timer**: Time period after which command is being re-run and text in status bar refreshed. s for seconds(1s), m for minutes(1m), h for hours(1h). Set to 0
to disable this feature for a corresponding action.

## Hacking and implementation guide
Comming soon!

## Miscellaneous
### Formating date with #Date built in program
Format a reference layout parameter (**Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006**) in a way that you would like to have your time formatted. 
If you have trouble check out this [guideline](https://www.golangprograms.com/get-current-date-and-time-in-various-format-in-golang.html).
### Escape sh commands
Some sh commands have characters (e.g. \\) which have a special meaning in JSON format. To easily escape them just dump your sh commands to
[json formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html).
### TODO
1. Create a built in module that displays weather condition.
2. Add implementation documentation
3. Add support for colour text in blocks.
